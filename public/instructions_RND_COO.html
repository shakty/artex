        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        You just became part of a community of 9 painters (including you).
        The community will collectively decide which paintings can be
        displayed in <strong>3 (three)</strong> artistic exhibitions (named A, B, and C).
        All the three exhibitions have the same value for the members of the community.
      </p>

      <p>
      Always keep in mind: In this game you will act both as an <em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>The game</h3>

      The game is divided in rounds, and each round is divided in three steps:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each artist creates 1 painting, and chooses 1 exhibition to which he / she submits the work of art.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2: </strong>Each artist reviews 3 of the 8 paintings produced by the other artists.
          The review is done by assigning a rating on a scale from 0 to 10.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3: </strong>All the paintings that received an average review-score
           greater than <em>5</em> are put on display in the exhibition to which they were
          submitted. If your painting is displayed you will receive a <em>payoff</em>.
          </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Who reviews what</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>At each round you will be <em>randomly</em> assigned to review 3 paintings, and you can never review your own painting.</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Payoff calculation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For participating in the game you will receive a fixed monetary compensation of <strong id="fixed-comp">10</strong> points, plus
            a variable amount based on your performance in the game.</li>
        <li>For each painting of yours that is displayed in one of the exhibitions you will
            be paid <strong id="variable-comp">2</strong> points.</li>
        <li>For each painting of yours that is not put on display you will receive <strong>0</strong> points.</li>
        <li>The maximum amount of money you can win is<span id="max-win">30*2 + 10 = <strong>70</strong></span> points.</li>
        <li>At the end of the game, points are converted into USD at the rate 1 USD = <span id="conversion-rate">1</span> point/s.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>

         <li>It is possible to copy paintings from the past exhibitions.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
