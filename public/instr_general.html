        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        You are part of a community of <strong>9</strong> painters
        (including you). You will play the role of both
        the <em>artist</em> and the <em>art critic</em>. The community
        will collectively decide which paintings can be displayed
        in <strong>3</strong> artistic
        exhibitions: <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>.

      </p>

      Always keep in mind: In this game you will act both as
      an <em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>.

      <p>
      <h3>The game</h3>

      The game is repeated <strong id="ng_replace_repeat"></strong>
      rounds. Each round is divided in 4 steps:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each participant creates 1
        painting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2: </strong>Each participant chooses 1
          exhibition to which to submit the painting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3: </strong>Each participant reviews 3 of the 8
          paintings produced by the other artists. The review is done
          by assigning a score on a scale from 0 to 10.
         </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Step 4: </strong> Paintings with a "high-enough"
            average review score are displayed
            in the exhibition of choice and generate
            <em>reward points</em> for their
            authors. Paintings that are not displayed never generate
            reward points. More details about the reward structure will be
            disclosed in <em>Part 2</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Who reviews what</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>At each round you will be assigned to
          review 3 paintings, and you can never review your own
          painting. More details about the review process will be
          disclosed in <em>Part 2</em>.</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>Other rules</h3>
      <ul>

         of the game. The time left will be displayed on the

         continue from your previous submission.</li>
