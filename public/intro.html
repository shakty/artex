      <p>
        The experiment is divided in two
        parts: <strong>Preparation</strong> and <strong>Game</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Part 1: Preparation</h3>

        In this part you will <strong>not</strong> interact with other
        players, and you <em>cannot</em> earn points unless explicitly
        mentioned on the screen. Part 1 involves three steps:

        <ul>
          <li>
            First, a basic <strong>psychological and
            demographics</strong> survey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Second, preliminary <strong>instructions</strong> of the game
            (full details disclosed in Part 2).
          </li>
          <li>
            Third, play in <strong>practice mode</strong>
            to get familiar with the game interface.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Part 2: Game</h3>


        In this part you will interact with <strong>other
        human</strong> participants. You might need to wait a short
        while until enough participants are connected.
        When enough participants have connected,
        the full details of the game will be disclosed to you,
        followed by a brief understanding quiz.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The game will be repeated for a certain number
            of <strong>rounds</strong>, and in each round you will
            have a chance to <strong>earn points</strong> based on
            your actions and the actions of other players.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the game,
            a <strong>questionnaire</strong> consisting in a short
            compulsory part and in a series of optional
            questions will follow.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Important!</strong> This part of the experiment
        is <em>synchronous</em>: it requires all participants to be
        connected and active at the same time. In the eventuality of a
        disconnection from the server, a popup message will appear
        with instructions how to reconnect.

      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Payout scheme</h3>

        If you complete the whole experiment (Part 1 + Part 2) you will
        receive rewards points:

        <ul>
          <li>
            a <strong>fixed reward</strong>
              of <span id="completion-fee">1</span> points, and
          </li>

          <li>
          a <strong>variable bonus</strong> depending on your actions in
           the experiment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Every
       <span id="exchange-rate">X</span> point/s you will earn 1 USD.
       </li>

      </p>
