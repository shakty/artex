        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        You just became part of a community of 9 painters (including you).
        The community will collectively decide which paintings can be
        displayed in <strong>3</strong> artistic exhibitions (named A, B, and C).
        All the three exhibitions have the same value for the members of the community.
      </p>

      <p>
      Always keep in mind: In this game you will act both as an <em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>The game</h3>

      The game is divided in rounds, and each round is divided in three steps:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each artist creates 1 painting, and chooses 1 exhibition to which he / she submits the work of art.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2: </strong>Each artist reviews 3 of the 8 paintings produced by the other artists.
          The review is done by assigning a rating on a scale from 0 to 10.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3: </strong>All the paintings that received an average review-score
           greater than <em>5</em> are put on display in the exhibition to which they were
          submitted. If your painting is displayed you will receive a <em>payoff</em>.
          </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

			<p>
      <h3>Who reviews what</h3>

        <ul>
	        <li>When you choose one exhibition, you increase your chances to become a reviewer for that exhibition in the <strong>next</strong> round.</li>
	        <li>If your painting is also published, your chances will be even higher.</li>
	        <li>You will always review 3 paintings, and you can never review your own painting.</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

			 <p>
      <h3>Payoff calculation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You will receive a fixed monetary compensation of <strong id="fixed-comp">10</strong> points, plus
            a variable amount based on your performance in the game.</li>
        <li>If one of your painting is published you will receive a sum equal to <strong>(3 / N)</strong> points, where N is the number of artists who published with you in the <strong>same</strong> exhibition.
        <table id="payoff">
          <tr>
            <td>N<td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Payoff</td><td>3</td><td>1.5</td><td>1</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.43</td><td>0.37</td><td>0.33</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </li>
        <li>If your painting is not published you will receive <strong>0</strong> points.</li>
        <li>The maximum amount of money you can win is 30*3 + 10 = <strong>100</strong> points.</li>

      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Other rules</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>You have a limited amount of time to complete each step of the game. The time left will be displayed on the screen.</li>
         <li>At each new round, when creating a new painting, you will continue from your previous submission.</li>
         <li>It is possible to copy paintings from the past exhibitions.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>The game will end either after <strong id="n-repeat">30</strong> rounds, or after <strong>1 hour</strong> of playing.</li>
         <li>In case of misconduct, cheating or disturbing behavior during the game, you will not be paid any money.</li>
